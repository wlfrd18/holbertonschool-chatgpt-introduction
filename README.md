# Project: Introduction to Random Number Generation in Python

Welcome to the Introduction to Random Number Generation in Python project! This project focuses on enhancing code quality and efficiency by using Python to generate random numbers. Through a series of exercises, youâ€™ll learn how to integrate fundamental random number generation concepts into your everyday coding practices. 

## Implemented by

Xavier J. Cruz (based on content by HBTN) 

## Objectives

+ Random Number Generation: Understand how to use the random.random() function to generate random numbers between 0 and 1. 

+ Loops and Automation: Learn how to use a for loop to execute code multiple times and display multiple results. 

+ Code Documentation: Use comments and documentation to make your code more understandable and maintainable. 

+ Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to prevent program crashes during random number generation.

## Exercises

+ Random Number Generation - Introduction

+ Create a simple Python program to generate and display 10 random numbers between 0 and 1.

+ Formatted Display of Generated Numbers

+ Add code to format and display the generated numbers with a specified number of decimal places.

+ Advanced Use of random.random()
